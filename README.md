# Why I did this
I heard that the New York Times may make their games paid for, which is like what they are doing with their newspaper and online stories.

# Note to the New York Times
I will not take any part of this down until you make **ALL** the source code private. Since, currently it is public to the whole modern world, if you know how to do it, it is only right to help people that don't know how to, be able to learn from the code, which in turn may help other's learn to code. Please also note, I do not mean any harm to the institution of The New York Times, as this is for learning purposes only.
